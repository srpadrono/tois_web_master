# Product Requirements Document: Tois MVP

## Introduction/Overview

Tois is a lightweight digital web application designed to help pediatric occupational therapists create and deliver personalized sensory home programs for children. The platform enables therapists to assign structured, engaging activities that families can follow at home, supporting consistency, improving clinical outcomes, and reducing administrative time.

The MVP focuses on core functionality that allows therapists to build customized sensory programs from a preloaded activity library, share them with caregivers, and track basic completion feedback to inform future sessions.

## Goals

1. **Reduce Administrative Burden**: Streamline the creation and distribution of home sensory programs for pediatric occupational therapists
2. **Improve Family Engagement**: Provide clear, structured activities that caregivers can confidently implement at home
3. **Enhance Clinical Outcomes**: Enable consistent tracking of activity completion and child responses to inform treatment planning
4. **Support Multi-Therapist Practices**: Allow multiple therapists within a practice to collaborate and share resources
5. **Ensure Compliance**: Maintain HIPAA-ready data security and privacy standards

- Caregiver-to-caregiver communication or forums

## Design Considerations

- **Responsive Design**: Must work seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Open Questions

1. Should there be a limit on the number of clients per therapist account?
2. What specific image file formats and size limits should be supported for activity uploads?
3. Should caregivers be able to add notes or photos when providing feedback?
4. Do we need audit trails for compliance purposes beyond basic activity logging?
5. Should therapists be able to share custom activities with other therapists in their practice?
6. What subscription tiers and pricing structure should be implemented?
7. Should there be reminder notifications for caregivers if activities aren't completed?
